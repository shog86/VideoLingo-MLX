### Language Support

**Input Language Support(more to come):**

🇺🇸 English 🤩 | 🇷🇺 Russian 😊 | 🇫🇷 French 🤩 | 🇩🇪 German 🤩 | 🇮🇹 Italian 🤩 | 🇪🇸 Spanish 🤩 | 🇯🇵 Japanese 😐 | 🇨🇳 Chinese* 😊

> *Chinese uses a separate punctuation-enhanced whisper model, for now...

**Translation supports all languages, while dubbing language depends on the chosen TTS method.**

> **Note:** FFmpeg is required. Please install it via Homebrew:
> - macOS: ```brew install ffmpeg``` (via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/))

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Huanshere/VideoLingo.git
cd VideoLingo
```

2. Install dependencies (requires `conda`)

```bash
bash run_installer.sh
```

streamlit run st.py
```

## APIs
VideoLingo supports OpenAI-Like API format and various TTS interfaces:
- LLM: `claude-3-5-sonnet`, `gpt-4.1`, `deepseek-v3`, `gemini-2.0-flash`, ... (sorted by performance, be cautious with gemini-2.5-flash...)
- Whisper: Run MLX-Whisper locally (recommended for Mac), or use ElevenLabs ASR API.
- TTS: `azure-tts`, `openai-tts`, `siliconflow-fishtts`, **`fish-tts`**, `GPT-SoVITS`, `edge-tts`, `*custom-tts`(You can modify your own TTS in custom_tts.py!)

> **Note:** VideoLingo works with **[302.ai](https://gpt302.saaslink.net/C2oHR9)** - one API key for all services (LLM, WhisperX, TTS). Or run locally with Ollama and Edge-TTS for free, no API needed!

> **Important:** For multi-character diarization, you must:
> 1. Create a [Hugging Face Access Token](https://hf.co/settings/tokens).
> 2. Accept terms for [pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1](https://hf.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1) and [pyannote/segmentation-3.0](https://hf.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0).
> 3. Enter your token in the Streamlit sidebar or `config.yaml`.

For detailed installation, API configuration, and batch mode instructions, please refer to the documentation: [English](/docs/pages/docs/start.en-US.md) | [中文](/docs/pages/docs/start.zh-CN.md)

## Current Limitations

1. Whisper transcription performance may be affected by video background noise. For videos with loud background music, please enable Voice Separation Enhancement.

2. Using weaker models can lead to errors during processes due to strict JSON format requirements for responses (tried my best to prompt llm😊). If this error occurs, please delete the `output` folder and retry with a different LLM.

3. The dubbing feature may not be 100% perfect due to differences in speech rates and intonation between languages.

4. **Multi-character dubbing** is now supported via Pyannote diarization (experimental).
